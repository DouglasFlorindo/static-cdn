To be honest, I spent a lot of time thinking of a cool crossover. I considered Rhythm Doctor, Darkest Dungeon and Tangle Tower, but none of them seemed right... Then a friend suggested that \"Dick Gumshoe would be funny\", and, even though this crossover makes absolutely no sense, I think Beowulf (dumb as a rock) as a detective is pretty funny indeed. (Plus both are himbos, my favorite gender :eggbug:).</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;max-width:100%;justify-content: center;margin-bottom:0\">\n<img style=\"margin:0;width:50%;object-fit:cover\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fR6dWS1.png\" alt=\"Beowulf\">\n<img style=\"margin:0;width:50%;object-fit:cover\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XryYU6e.png\" alt=\"Dick Gumshoe\">\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i>Beowulf and Dick Gumshoe, respectively.</i></p>\n<p>Just Beowulf standing in the void would be pretty boring, so I started sketching some background ideas. When I think of a detective, <i>Noir</i> visuals always comes to mind, so I needed contrast, I needed drama! While it isn't a new composition, a dark office with a bright window will always catch my eyes...</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;max-width:100%;justify-content: center;object-fit:cover;margin-bottom:0\">\n<img style=\"margin:0;width:50%\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u3AvsKP.png\" alt=\"Sketch thumbnail\">\n<img style=\"margin:0;width:50%\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7qp0GSU.png\" alt=\"Final sketch\">\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i>Thumbnail and final sketch, respectively.</i></p>\n<p>I decided to go with a basic one point perspective, lining up one element after the other. I struggled a lot trying to find the right proportions of the objects, but some trial and error later I reached a decent result. I also tried balancing the amount of information in both sides of the screen, so the plant is opposing the jacket, and the lamp is opposing his right arm. Besides that, the whole look of the office comes from an amalgamation of some cool concept arts I found online.</p>\n<p>Regarding Beowulf himself, I tried making his pose to be a \"(\" curve, but still maintaining his balance. So you can see that most of his upper parts are leaning to the right, while the bottom parts are leaning to the left, making that curve. I also decided to make the jacket be affected by the curve to add a little of movement to the piece.</p>\n<p>Making the palette was for sure one of my favorite parts! Recently I've been way more open to adding green to my pieces, and Gumshoe's palette has some green \"implications\", so I <i>had</i> to use it here. Overall, my palette is composed of:</p>\n<div style=\"margin:0; height:3.5rem;width:100%;background:#151C13;display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:flex-end\"><p style=\"margin:0;color:#f7f78c\">Dark and dessaturated greens.</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin:0; height:3.5rem;width:100%;background:#582506;display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:flex-end\"><p style=\"margin:0;color:#f7f78c\">Brownish and strong reds.</p></div>\n<div style=\"margin:0; height:3.5rem;width:100%;background:#f7f78c;display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:flex-end\"><p style=\"margin:0;color:#151C13\">And bright and light yellows.</p></div>\n<p>Most of the objects are some shade of green, then some spots use red to break the monotony. And, finally, the whole composition is illuminated by yellow.</p>\n<p>Regarding rendering, most objects are too small to have detailed rendering, so I went with a more rough look, which I like a lot!!</p>"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtXdibxWIYY"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"\n<p>I really don't expect to be one of the winners, but I wouldn't complain...
