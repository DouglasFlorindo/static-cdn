It's weird to realize that I never had a clear objective, still I always treated social media like an actual influecer do: basically trying to grow exponentially etc etc. And, for the first time, I came to the conclusion that the social media game is not for me."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I won't extend on my motives right now, but, what I can say is that I won't stop posting. Sharing my art, seeing other people reactions, inspiring and creating stuff is a passion that has always been there, but just now I started paying attention to it. But it can't coexist with my \"influencer urge\", so I'll stop pushing myself too hard and will do what I want without caring for attention or numbers."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"So, Joel G just released a new teaser for his webserie ENA, and so came the urge to draw them again. ENA is that kind of character that is just so easy to draw and style that you have to draw them at least once."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4beohSJvihk"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I always wanted to make a character interacting with it's own media, and ENA is the perfect subject for that. Even though I didn't developed the concept too much, I'm happy that I finally made something in that caliber!"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"ENA is all about contrast, so I wanted to reflect that in some aspects. Just like their colors contrast a lot between hot and cold, and bright and dark, their pose also has contrast. I wouldn't say that I fully acomplished what I wanted, but ENA's pose is primarily a fluid and balanced one, until their head and legs purposefully breaks that. Still on that line of thought, you can also noticed that opposite parts of their body are closer and further from the viewer."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"<img style=\"margin:0\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/65N03rh.png\" alt=\"Scheme representing what was said above.\">"}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"Overall, this piece was made primarily for fun and indeed it was fun! For the surprise of no one, letting yourself create silly stuff just for fun sometimes is really healthy!! "}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I also recorded a timelapse!
