To be honest, I haven't practiced the torso as much as I wanted before I dived into the arms and their roots, but it was good enough. Regarding the arms, I wanted to give a highlight to those little muscles that are often hidden by the skin, the brachial and the coracobrachialis (both under the biceps), and exaggerate the muscles shapes, like in the triceps. And for that I couldn't have drawn anyone but my favorite wrestler <span aria-label=\"Beowulf\" style=\"color: #0000; background: linear-gradient(90deg, #f00, #ff2b00, #f50, #ff8000, #fa0, #ffd500, #ff0, #d4ff00, #af0, #80ff00, #5f0, #2bff00, #0f0, #00ff2b, #0f5, #00ff80, #0fa, #00ffd5, #0ff, #00d4ff, #0af, #007fff, #05f, #002bff, #00f, #2a00ff, #50f, #7f00ff, #a0f, #d400ff, #f0f, #ff00d4, #f0a, #ff0080, #f05, #ff002b, #f00); background-clip: text; -webkit-background-clip: text;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out -1.5s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">B</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out -1s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">e</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out -0.5s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">o</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out 0s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">w</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out 0.5s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">u</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">l</span><span style=\"display: inline-block; animation: 1.2s ease-in-out 1.5s infinite alternate none running spin; transform: translateY(-15%);\">f</span></span>."}},{"type":"markdown","markdown":{"content":"I thought of making a more complex and interesting perspective/composition, but I felt that it would be a bigger step that I can't take yet. Regarding colors and texture, I'm actually quite satisfied with the result I achieved! Usually I tend to render more than I'd like (because of zooming in too much), which makes the brush texture irrelevent. But in this one I achieved a level of texture that I enjoy a lot! Another challenge was making a colder palette than I'm normally used too. Lately I've noticed that I use a lot of orange in my paintings, and I wanted to try something different. I wouldn't say that I made huge differences to my previous palettes, but I'm happy I was able to use more purple and pale colours in a consistent color scheme.
